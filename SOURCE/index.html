<h1>Node Editor Framework</h1>

<h2 id="About">About</h2>
<p>
	Welcome to the hompage of the opensource Node Editor Framework! <br>
	It is a project initially started by <a href="https://forum.unity.com/members/seneral.638015/">Seneral</a> (the creator of the webpage) back in May 2015.
	It has since evolved greatly to a flexible and general framework and has been used by hundreds of users, including a few on the Asset Store like MegaSplats.
	<br>
	A <a href="https://github.com/Seneral/Node_Editor_Framework">GitHub repository</a> has been setup in the early stages with the help of <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/members/baste.185905/">Baste</a> and is the main development platform. Go check it out!
	<br>
	On this website all other content related to the Node Editor Framework is hosted, including the Documentation (WIP), any future Guides aswell as the WebGL Demo.
	<br>
</p>

<h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
<p>
	Several generic features make the Node Editor Framework stand out from even some closed frameworks on the store:
	<ul>
		<li>Fully-featured and extensible interface</li>
		<li>Extensive controls including zooming/panning</li>
		<li>Super extensible with runtime-fetching of custom nodes, connections, canvas, traversal routines and controls</li>
		<li>Advanced save- and cache system, including saving to Scene, Asset and XML</li>
		<li>Complete runtime support (see WebGL demo)</li>
		<li>Clean, structured and commented code!</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="Contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>
	If you want to contribute to this framework or have improved this framework internally to suit your needs better, 
	please consider creating a Pull Request with your changes when they could help the framework become better. <br>
	The <a href="https://github.com/Seneral/Node_Editor_Framework/issues">issues section</a> serves as a feature discussion forum 
	and I encourage you to check it out to get an idea of the future plans for the framework. 
	You can also PM the main developer <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/">Seneral</a> directly if you wish so.
